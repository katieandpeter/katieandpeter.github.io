## Bockfest

Perhaps one of Cincinnati's quirkiest beer festivals, Bockfest is the celebration of [Bock-style beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bock) and the coming of spring with the accompaniment of a parade, goats (Bock is also the word for goat in German), the wearing of Tracht (Dirndls and Lederhosen), German food (esp. Bavarian style), dancing, and live music. It was first celebrated in 1992 in OTR and has become part of the identity of the neighborhood. It's one of Cincinnati's first major festivals of the year and simply cannot be missed.
