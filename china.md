## Ride-hailing

Uber and other ride-hailing services in China can be difficult for tourists as many drivers do not speak English. They also commonly reach out via text message before picking you up to confirm your ride. Use the following Chinese message to ensure a smooth pick-up.

> 你好，我是外国游客，不会中文，我在定位的地方等你，请按导航来接我，谢谢

Roughly translated, it means:

> Hello, I'm a foreign tourist and don't speak Chinese. I'm waiting for you at the pickup location. Please use the navigation to pick me up. Thank you!
