![A Photo of Us]({{ "/assets/img/us.jpg" | relative_url }})

We are a married couple based in [Cincinnati, Ohio, USA][cincy] and have lived in the
old German immigrant neighborhood of [Over-the-Rhine][otr] for over 10 years. We love
to travel, attend music and cultural festivals, organize our lives together, and
sit at our local bar and strike up conversations with neighbors and fellow humans.

Katie has a history in the education sector, having taught English to kids, taken
on principalship, and collaborated with a wide range of schools to develop their
curriculum. She is now working with [Generation Schools Network][gsn] as an
accountability consultant.

Peter has long been a technology fiend and after studying Information Systems at the
[University of Cincinnati][uc], took up various roles in IT support, server admin,
and web application development. He now works with [Benchmark Digital Solutions][benchmark]
as a Product Design & Development Director.
