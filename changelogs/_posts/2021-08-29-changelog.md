It's been a busy year since we got fully vaccinated but it's been a blast
being able to travel once again. Let's hope things remain stable in this
crazy old world. The following updates have been made to our site:

- All of our latest trips have been added to the [Travel Log](/travellog)
- Added a [guide](/colorclass) for classifying things in our lives by color
- Added a [note-taking guide](/notetaking) to compile various note-taking tips and tricks
- Added a [cocktail recipe](/cocktails) page highlighting some of our favorite drinks

We're looking forward to more travels this year and sharing more with the world.
