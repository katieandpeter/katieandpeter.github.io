This site is now available in dark mode! It should automatically change
modes based on whatever you have configured in your OS. The link color
has also been changed to blue to help make it pop a bit more.

More content is on its way soon. We still need to compile all of our notes
from various platforms including written journals, so it's a bit more of a
process. We will slowly and patiently build it up.
